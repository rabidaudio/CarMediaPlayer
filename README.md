Car Media Player
================

>Written by Charles Knight, <charles@rabidaudio.com>

This is a simple Python music player which uses SQLite for a database,
Mutagen for tag reading, and GStreamer for playback, taking inspiration
and occasionally hints from my favorite music player of all time, [Quod
Libet](http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/).

Eventually, all UI (button presses and display) will be handled by an
Arduino connected via RS232; however, it wouldn't be too difficult to
make a GUI for it (via pyGTK or similar).

This project is *very much* still under development, meaning it has
limitted functionality, error handling, and documentation.
