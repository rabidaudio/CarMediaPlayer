Car Media Player
================

>Written by Charles Knight, <charles@rabidaudio.com>

This is a simple ~~Python~~ Node.js music player taking inspiration
and occasionally hints from my favorite music player of all time, [Quod
Libet](http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/).

All UI (button presses and display) is be handled by an
Arduino connected via RS232.

The player is simply a series of streams( fileReadStream -> lame -> speaker ).
Learning streams has been exciting and useful.

This project is *very much* still under development, meaning it has
limitted functionality, error handling, and documentation.
